Just a silly little project created with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The only interactive item on this page as of right now is the dark mode toggle button in the top left. When clicking on this button, it should change the background black and the text of the page a light gray. The button itself should be black when it's in "light mode", and light with black text when in "dark mode"
